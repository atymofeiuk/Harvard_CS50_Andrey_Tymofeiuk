    Important: This code is placed at GitHub to track my progress in programming and
    to show my way of thinking. Also I will be happy if somebody finds my solution
    interesting. But I do respect The Honor Code and I ask you to respect it also - please
    don't submit this solution to the CS50 grader and do not copy it.
